# Equipment Description
Welcome to the equipment area! There is only one proper section, which cleans it up compared to the Google Doc.

If I haven't listed an item that was featured in a video, it most likely means I don't use it. This list is also updated when I change equipment (which isn't that often).
Most things will be hyper-linked, some will take to a product page, some will take to an image that I took. Ones without hyper-linking, I can't find a link for the product + didn't bother to take a picture.
